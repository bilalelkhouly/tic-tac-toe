# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Introduction
This is a Python-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It offers both single-player and multiplayer modes, providing an enjoyable gaming experience for one or two players.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode:** Play against an AI computer opponent that makes strategic moves.
- **Multiplayer Mode:** Compete with a friend in a traditional two-player game.
- **Winning Detection:** The game detects winning combinations and announces the winner.
- **Tie Detection:** In case of a tie, the game declares it.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file in your Python environment.
2. You will be prompted to choose a game mode:
   - Single Player (S): Play against the computer.
   - Multiplayer (M): Play against a friend.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to make moves by entering row and column numbers.
4. The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie.

## AI Computer Player

- The computer player in single-player mode employs a basic AI algorithm to make strategic moves.
- It attempts to win the game or block the opponent from winning.
- If no winning or blocking move is available, it makes a random move.

## Game Board

- The game board is displayed using a text-based grid.
- Players make moves by specifying row and column numbers.
- The board is updated after each move, showing the X and O symbols.
